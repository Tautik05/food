# 🍔 Django Dine & Dash 🚀

Welcome to **Django Dine & Dash**, the app that believes good food shouldn’t just be delivered to your door, but should also make you giggle. We’ve combined Django's powerful web framework with our insatiable appetite for pizza (and other delicacies) to create a food delivery app that is faster than a cheetah on roller skates!

## Features 🥳

- **Lightning-Fast Delivery:** Our delivery partners are trained in the art of speed. They can dodge traffic like ninjas and will arrive at your door before you can say “I’m starving!”

- **Menu Galore:** Choose from a variety of cuisines! Italian, Chinese, Indian, or just good ol’ junk food. We even have a special “I Just Got Dumped” section for comfort food. 

- **One-Click Ordering:** Because we know you don’t want to spend more time selecting food than eating it. Just one click and your feast is on its way!

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Watch your food travel faster than your heart rate when you see the delivery guy approach. 

- **Customizable Orders:** Want extra pickles? No problem! Want to remove the tomato because of that one bad experience in 2015? We got you!

## How to Use This App 🍕👨‍🍳

1. **Install Requirements:** Make sure you have Python and Django installed. If you don’t, it’s a bit like trying to bake a cake without an oven. It just won’t work. 
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Set Up the Database: Because we don’t want to serve you stale data. Run the migrations faster than your mom can judge your life choices.

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate

3. Start the Server: Fire up the Django server and get ready for some serious food-finding action!
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver

4. Order Your Food: Navigate to http://localhost:8000 and start ordering! Don’t forget to take a moment to appreciate how amazing you are for choosing this app.
